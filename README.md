# archinstaller.sh
This is an automated installation script for arch linux.

## Prerequisites
- You are booted into an arch linux environment
- An internet connection has been set up
- The configuration found in ari.conf is valid
- The script is run as 'root' user

### packages
The utitlities needed by the script can be installed with the following packages: arch-install-scripts, wget.
Based on your setup, other packages might be needed: gptfdisk for GPT support, dosfstools for UEFI support, btrfs-progs and nilfs-utils for the respective filesystems.
All utilities are included on the arch linux iso, which can be downloaded here: https://www.archlinux.org/download/

## Download
### With git
- clone the repository: `git clone git://github.com/vitamins/archinstaller`

### Without git
- download the tarball: `wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/vitamins/archinstaller/tarball/master -O - | tar xz`

## Usage
- Edit the configuration file ari.conf with your favorite editor: `nano ari.conf` or generate it using `bash ./ari_gen.sh`
- Check if dest_disk refers to the correct drive with `lsblk`
- Make the script executable: `chmod +x ./archinstaller.sh`
- Run the script: `./archinstaller.sh`

## Features
- Simple configuration using a single file
- Can run completely automated
- Always downloads the latest packages
- Handles GPT and MBR partition tables
- Supports UEFI booting with GRUB or gummiboot
- Allows you to choose between GRUB and syslinux bootloader
- Configure basic system settings: language,timezone,keymap,font and hostname
- Optionally create and activate a swap partition
- Choose how much space to allocate for swap and root partition
- A home partition is created on the remaining space
- Decide which filesystems to use for root and home partition
- Supports encrypting the home partition using LUKS and dm-crypt
- Allows you to download packages from the preferred mirror
- Can install additional packages
- Allows you to set a root password
- Allows you to add an additional non-root user
- Allows you to configure the network with dhcpcd, netctl or ifplugd
- Allows you to install Xorg
- Officially supported desktop environments: xfce4,gnome,kde,cinnamon,lxde,enlightenment17
- Allows you to install a display manager

### Partitioning
At the beginning, the partition layout is cleared, and a new partition table is created on the storage device.
Partition sizes are not checked by the script, if they are too big, the script will fail. For accommodating the base system and a minimal set of applications, the root partition should be at least 3 Gigabytes in size. By default, the EFI System Partition "ESP" has a size of 512M, to override this set the variable "esp_size". The home partition takes up remaining space on the storage device, unless you set "home_size". The order of the partitions is from first to last ESP, swap, root, and home.

### Manual Partitioning
If you want to create the partitions and filesystems on your own, set "manual_part" to "yes". Then the following assumptions are made by the script:
- The partitions contain newly created filesystems.
- The root partition is mounted to /mnt.
- If using UEFI, the ESP is mounted to /mnt/boot.
- Any other seperate partition like /usr or /var is mounted below the /mnt/ directory.
- The variables "dest_disk" and "root_partition_number" point to the root partition. The bootloader will be installed on "dest_disk", and requires information about the "root_partition_number" for its configuration.
- The variable "partition_table" is set according to the partition table used for the root partition.
- The partitions are manually unmounted before rebooting.

Manual partitioning allows you to use this script with more complex setups, such as lvm or RAID. In that case, you have to configure the necessary settings on your own. For example for lvm, it is necessary to add the lvm hook to mkinitcpio.conf and regenerate the initramfs.

### Language
The language settings in "locale_gen" and "locale_conf" are not checked by the script. In case you make an configuration error here, locale settings fall back to en_US and the script continues. The same is true for the commandline font.

### Additional Packages
There are two possibilities to make the script install additional packages. You can simply add them to the packages array in the configuration file. Alternatively you can write the packages to `pkglist.txt`, one on each line. To generate a list of explicitly installed packages on an existing installation, use this command: `pacman -Qqen > pkglist.txt` You can also use both options at the same time, duplicate entries are eliminated by pacman.
All of the packages must be part of the core,extra or community repositories. Please notice that it is not possible to install multilib packages with the script. Should one of the packages not be found in the repositories, then this step is skipped.

### Passwords
Passwords are not stored in the script or configuration file. During installation, you are beeing asked for entering the passwords by the underlying program like `passwd`.
When using encryption, think about a strong passphrase before starting the installation.

### Encryption
If you want to encrypt the home partition with LUKS and dm-crypt set "encrypt_home" to "yes". Additionally details like cipher, hash algorithm and key size can be configured. The respective variables are "cipher","hash_alg" and "key_size". Run "# cryptsetup benchmark" for a list of available options and their performance. The defaults are set to cipher='aes-xts-plain64', hash_alg='sha1' and key_size='256'.
